# Bug Tracker v1.0

This project is my attempt at solving real world software problems. All companies need a way to track bugs, or else the development process would take much longer. In this project, I used React and Redux to create a full stack bug tracker. The front end is employed using a Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. The backend is employed using a  REST API deployed on localhost. I used MongoDB as the database, and use Mongoose to connect to database. I created HTTP routes using Express. I used JavaScript to pull data from the API, create logic for the controllers, and manage views. The UI is styled using HTML and CSS 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed Node.js, React, Redux, Express, Nodemon, Mongoose and can access its modules
* You have reviewed the React documentation. The documentation is here: https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
* You have reviewed the Redux documentation. The documentation is here:  https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started
* You have reviewed the Express documentation. The documentation is here: https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html
* You have reviewed the Nodemon documentation. The documentation is here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon
* You have reviewed the Mongoose documentation. The documentation is here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose
* You have created a database using MongoDB

## Installing and using the bug tracker

To install the bug tracker, follow React documentation. Most of these files come with the npx create-react-app command, the only changes are in the src file. The Youtube.js file is the main script of this web app. 

Should you want to make changes to this app:
* You must use your own MongoDB database and the DB URL must be in a .env file 
* Review the file and the comments I've made in the code. 
* You must follow the MVC design pattern.
* You have reviewed the Express documentation for server and route information.
